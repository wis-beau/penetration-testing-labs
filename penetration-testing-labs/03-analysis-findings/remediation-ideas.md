# Remediation Ideas (High-Level)

- **Patch / Upgrade**: Replace backdoored or outdated services (vsftpd, UnrealIRCd, Apache, databases).
- **Disable Unused Services**: Telnet, rsh, exec, X11, VNC, extra FTP instances, etc.
- **Network Segmentation & Firewalls**: Restrict access to only required ports; deny by default.
- **Least Privilege**: Lock down service accounts; avoid running network services as root.
- **Integrity Verification**: Verify software downloads via **checksums/signatures** to avoid Trojaned builds.
- **Monitoring & IDS/IPS**: Add network monitoring (e.g., Suricata/Snort) and alerting on anomalous traffic.
- **Regular Scans**: Schedule authenticated scans and routine service inventory reviews.
